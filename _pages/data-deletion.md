## How to Delete Your Data

We respect your privacy and provide simple ways to delete your data.

### 1. Data Stored on Your Device

All travel and family data (such as trips, packing lists, and documents) is stored locally on your device.

To delete this data:

- Uninstall the app from your device  
- Or clear the app’s storage in your device settings  

This will permanently remove all locally stored data.

These services may store:

- Email address
